# pfSense_Playbook

By now pfSense2.4.4-p2 does not work in way to make easy the management an environment with a lot of pfSense instances, but it's possible manage some taks by terminal like create alias, rules, backups and packages/system update, so I've built this very basic ansible playbook to run these activities in a easiest way using Ansible.
